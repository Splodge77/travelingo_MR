## JavaScript Group Project Guidelines


AIMS/PURPOSE:

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these
- To have the opportunity to try using agile working methods
- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork. 
- To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class, and if you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

EXPECTATIONS/WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE:

- All members of the group contributing to the planning, development and presentation of the project
- Members supporting each other and communicating well - be nice!
- Some TDD - unit testing of models
- Some application of Agile concepts e.g. a morning standup, sprints, a kanban board (/Trello) or planning poker
- Regular Git commits and use of branches

SUGGESTIONS

- At the start of the project have a discussion about what you all want to get out of it. Some people may be more focused on practicing what they’ve already learned, some may be keen to try out a specific new thing. Some people may have a preference of what area they want to focus on but if you’re all leaning towards the same area… someone has to do the other parts!
- Plan thoroughly so you’re all on the same page of the aim for the end result. Set out a MVP. Split the project into small features to tackle one at a time.
- It can work well to set up the basic app, directories etc together first so you all understand the core structure before you split up to work on different features. 
- Use git branches!! COMMIT REGULARLY! A week long group project should have 100+ commits. Probably 150-200+!
