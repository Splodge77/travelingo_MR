## Group Project Roles

 - Product Owner
 - Scrum Master
 - Scrum Team (developers, testers, designers, UX. Have a "we" attitude and cross-train each other)


## The Waterfall Methodology

 Waterfall is a linear approach to software development. In this methodology, the sequence of events is something like:

  - Gather and document requirements
  - Design
  - Code and unit test
  - Perform system testing
  - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT)
  - Fix any issues
  - Deliver the finished product

## Drawbacks of waterfall

 - One area which almost always falls short is the effectiveness of requirements. Gathering and documenting requirements in a way that is meaningful to a customer is often the most difficult part of software development

 - Waterfall development has the possibility that the customer will be dissatisfied with their delivered software product.


Scrum is not "waterfall with stand-ups"

Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing agile. So popular, in fact, that many people think scrum and agile are the same thing. (They're not.) Many frameworks can be used to implement agile, such as kanban for example, but scrum has a unique flavor because of the commitment to short iterations of work.

## What's so special about scrum?

With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence. Milestones–i.e., the end of a sprint–come frequently, bringing with them a feeling of tangible progress with each cycle that focuses and energizes everyone. ("Continuous inspiration" for the win!) Short iterations also reinforce the importance of good estimation and fast feedback from tests–both recurring struggles in waterfall projects.

Scrum calls for four ceremonies that bring structure to each sprint:

1. Sprint planning: A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint.
2. Daily stand-up: Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync.
3. Sprint demo: A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint.
4. Sprint retrospective: A review of what did and didn't go well with actions to make the next sprint better.
5. During a sprint, visual artifacts like task boards and burndown charts, visible to the team and spectators alike, are powerful motivators. They drive a spirit of "we're doing this!" Having the opportunity to show off new work at the sprint demo is equally motivating, and the consistent, incremental feedback the team gets from stakeholders at each demo creates a powerful way to develop products.


Scrum done well–which is to say, not "waterfall with stand-ups"–can be a massive catalyst for improving team productivity and morale, and the product development process as a whole.

Three essential roles for scrum success

A scrum team has a slightly different composition than a traditional waterfall project, with three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team. And because scrum teams are cross-functional, "the development team" includes testers, designers, and ops engineers in addition to developers.

## The product owner

Product owners are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. Effective product owners:

#### Build and manage the product backlog

Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog
Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next
Decide when to ship the product with the predisposition towards more frequent delivery
Keep in mind that a product owner is not a project manager.

Product owners are not managing the status of the program. They focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business. Also, it's important that the product owner be an individual. No development team wants mixed guidance from multiple product owners.

## The scrum master

Scrum masters are the champion for scrum within their team. They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, they schedule the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.

Scrum masters also look to resolve impediments and distractions for the development team, insulating them from external disruptions whenever possible.

Part of the scrum master's job is to defend against an anti-pattern common among teams new to scrum: changing the sprint's scope after it has already begun. Product owners will sometimes ask, "Can't we get this one more super-important little thing into this sprint?" But keeping scope air tight reinforces good estimation and product planning–not to mention fends off a source of disruption to the development team.

Scrum masters are commonly mistaken for project managers, when in fact, project managers don't really have a place in the scrum methodology. A scrum team controls its own destiny and self-organizes around their work. Agile teams use pull models where the team pulls a certain amount of work off the backlog and commits to completing it that sprint, which is very effective in maintaining quality and ensuring optimum performance of the team over the long-term. Neither scrum masters nor project managers nor product owners push work to the team (which, by contrast, tends to erode both quality and morale).


## The scrum team

Scrum teams are the champions for sustainable development practices. The most effective scrum teams are tight-knit, co-located, and usually 5 to 7 members. Team members have differing skill sets, and cross-train each other so no one person becomes a bottleneck in the delivery of work. Strong scrum teams approach their project with a clear "we" attitude. All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.

As mentioned above, the scrum team drives the plan for each sprint. They forecast how much work they believe they can complete over the iteration using their historical velocity as a guide. Keeping the iteration length fixed gives the development team important feedback on their estimation and delivery process, which in turn makes their forecasts increasingly accurate over time.

### User Stories

A story or user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It is a software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language.

#### Example user story

User stories are sketched out by the product owner, then the full product team collectively decides the more detailed requirements. These are the granular pieces of work that help define the implementation items for the story and the upcoming sprint.

In a story, there are a set of tasks required, these tasks should be fleshed out during estimation of the user story and linked in the team's issue tracker.

Using the same example as above, the stories in this sprint have estimate, priority, assignee, epic and description showing, so everyone can get a quick view of the work being done.

 - As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
 - As a user, I can input deprature and return dates and view a list of available travel packages
 - As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive
 - 500 error when requesting a reservation
 - When requesting user details the server should return prior trip info
 - As a consumer, I want shopping cart functionality to easily purchase items online.
 - As an executive, I want to generate a report to understand which departments need to improve their productivity.

## Ceremonies

### Sprint planning

Required: development team, scrum master, product owner

When: At the beginning of a sprint.

Duration: Usually an hour per week of iteration–e.g. a two-week sprint kicks off with a two-hour planning meeting
success meeting the commitments of the sprint.

### Daily stand-up

When: Once per day, typically in the morning.

Duration: No more than 15 minutes. Don't book a conference room and conduct the stand up sitting down. Standing up helps keep the meeting short!

Purpose: Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. It's not a detailed status meeting. The tone should be light and fun, but informative. Have each team member answer the following questions:

 - What did I complete yesterday?
 - What will I work on today?
 - Am I blocked by anything?

## Iteration review

Required: development team, scrum master, product owner
Optional: project stakeholders

When: At the end of a sprint or milestone.

Duration: 30-60 minutes.

Agile Framework: Scrum and kanban. Like planning, review for kanban teams should be aligned with team milestones rather than on a fixed cadence.

Purpose: Iteration review is a time to showcase the work of the team. They can be in a casual format like "demo Fridays", or in a more formal meeting structure. This is the time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments, demonstrate work finished within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders. Remember, work should be fully demonstrable and meet the team's quality bar to be considered complete and ready to showcase in the review.

## Retrospective

Required: development team, scrum master, product owner

When: At the end of an iteration.

Duration: 60 minutes.

Agile Framework: Scrum and Kanban. Scrum teams do sprint retrospective based on a fixed cadence. Kanban teams can benefit from occasional retrospectives, too.

Purpose: Agile is about getting rapid feedback to make the product and development culture better. Retrospectives help the team understand what worked well–and what didn't.

STOP, START, CONTINUE

### Step by Step

1. Product Roadmap - A product roadmap is a plan of action for how a product or solution will evolve over time.
2. Backlog - A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements.
3. All work items should be included in the backlog: user stories, bugs, design changes, technical debt, customer requests, action items from the retrospective
4. Create list of user stories for first sprint
